I went to Right Way Auto for a safety and an oil change because of all the great reviews. The work my vehicle needed was completed quickly and professionally. And Andrey helped anyway he could. Highly recommend
Very knowledgeable, friendly staff, going well beyond to accommodate their customers needs. Their prices are very reasonable and I never feel like an unnecessary repair is pushed down on me. Highly recommend them.
The quality of the work and customer service is top notch. Both times I had been in they offered advice and options to choose from with no sales pressure. While my car was in they inspected it and offered to fix minor issues at a very reasonable price and offer assurances the car was otherwise in good working order. I will be taking my car there from now on."
Great Service Model. Someone once said, ‘It’s not the fact that a mistake is made, it’s how you deal with it that counts.’ Steve at Tom Dwyer has made me a believer in customer service excellence. I had a negative experience and he listened to my grievance, understood the challenges, and gave me viable solutions to resolve the situation. Such customer awareness and excellence deserves five stars! Thanks Steve!”
I went to them because it was conveniently located and they had a good rating on Angieslist. I felt that they redid the work that had already been done recently by the auto repair shop that I usually go to. I was not satisfied with their service.
